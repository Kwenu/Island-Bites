This is the Implementation part of our Software Development Group Project (CS-07).

The Introduction to our problem is:
The difficulty of locating and recognizing authentic Sri Lankan food varies based on your location in the country and your level of knowledge of the local culinary scene.

Here are some factors to consider:

1. Lack of user-generated authentic recipes:-
   Sri Lanka has a meager amount of user-generated recipe content. It would be beneficial to have a website that has user-generated authentic recipes which the users also can rate other users’ dishes

2. Geographic Location
   Depending on where you are in Sri Lanka, you may have trouble locating native food. You'll find a variety of options in popular tourist destinations like Colombo, Kandy, or Galle. On the other hand, finding a range of dining options could be more difficult if you're in a more rural or remote place.    

3. Language Barrier
   Since Tamil and Sinhala are the official languages of Sri Lanka, communication may be difficult while attempting to identify regional cuisine if you are not fluent in either language. While this may not always be the case, many eateries and food vendors in tourist regions may offer English-speaking personnel or menus.

4. Local Markets
   The best way to experience Sri Lankan cuisine is to visit local markets and street food vendors. You can try traditional Sri Lankan dishes like hoppers, dhal curry, achcharu, kottu roti, and string hoppers in these places. However, finding the best vendors may require some local guidance and recommendations.

5. Lack of sources
   Especially for tourists and Sri Lankans who live abroad, finding and even identifying Sri Lankan cuisine might be a huge problem. It’s mainly because Sri Lankan cuisine is so vast and different from Western cultures. Most Sri Lankan cuisine requires some culinary knowledge due to the use of many kinds of ingredients.

In conclusion, discovering and recognizing regional Sri Lankan food can be a fun gastronomic journey, although it might take some work, particularly in less visited locations. To help you uncover Sri Lanka's true flavors our web application could do most of the hard work.
